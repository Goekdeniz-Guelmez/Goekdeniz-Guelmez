# Hello, I'm Gökdeniz Gülmez 👋

## 🚀 About Me
Hi there, I'm Gökdeniz Gülmez. A passionate AI & ML researcher in my free time and a skilled ML engineer at work. I'm a contributer for [mlx-examples](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-examples). I Added support for MiniCPM, Mamba version 1 (version 2 is comming) and support for full-fine-tuning, and wil go on.

## 📚 My Projects
Here you'll find a variety of projects showcasing my journey in AI and ML. From beginner's experiments to sophisticated models.

## 🎯 My Interests
- 🤖 Artificial Intelligence.
- 🧠 Machine and Deep Learning.
- 🎵 Violin - Currently practicing Niccolò Paganini, bach and more.
- 🖌️ Occasionally, I dabble in painting and photography.
- 📺 Avid anime fan, always ready for a good series recommendation.

## 🌱 I’m currently perfecting...
- Autonomous Smart home automation using Real-Time, Multi-Modal Model. capable text-audio-vision to text-audio (Project J.O.S.I.E.v4o).

## My private goal is to create J.O.S.I.E.
### My own private smart home management MLLM Assistant that can...
- Autonomously control and manage my Smart home with sensors, cameras, LEDs, and all the other products.
- Tool calling capabilies.
- Raw audio input with normal user(s) speech and other sounds like (fire, etc.).
- Capable of understanding videos and images (e.g. security cameras).
- Capable of outputting natural assistant audio speech and Text (like GPT4-o).
- Can be Real-Time and Text only like GPT4-o.
- Updating itself Autonomously.
- Having a long-/short-term Memory, and even updating it autonimously.
- Real-Time-full-duplex-Multi-Modal-Model
- Starting a conversation by itself (She donsn't need special user and assistant turns).
- And much more...]
