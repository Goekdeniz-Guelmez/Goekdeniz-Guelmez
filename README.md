# Hello, I'm G√∂kdeniz G√ºlmez üëã

## üöÄ About Me

Hey, I‚Äôm G√∂kdeniz G√ºlmez ‚Äî an ML researcher and engineer. When I‚Äôm not building production systems, I‚Äôm deep in the MLX ecosystem, contributing to cutting-edge tooling for Apple Silicon.

I'm a contributor to [mlx-vlm](https://github.com/Blaizzy/mlx-vlm), [mlx-examples](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-examples), [mlx-lm](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-lm), and [mlx](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx), officially acknowledged by the MLX team ‚Äî check here for [mlx-examples](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-examples/blob/main/ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.md), [mlx-lm](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-lm/blob/main/ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.md) or [mlx](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx/blob/main/ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.md) if you don‚Äôt believe me.

### üì¶ Creator of:

* [**MLX-LM-LENS**](https://github.com/Goekdeniz-Guelmez/mlx-lm-lens.git): Abliterate and research the inner thoughs of LLMs
* [**MLX-LM-LoRA**](https://github.com/Goekdeniz-Guelmez/mlx-lm-lora): Train models natively on Apple Silicon
* [**MLX-KAN**](https://github.com/Goekdeniz-Guelmez/mlx-kan): KANs implemented natively in MLX
* [**Local NotebookLM**](https://github.com/Goekdeniz-Guelmez/Local-NotebookLM): Run your own "NotebookLM" locally with PDF context

### üß† What I‚Äôve built into MLX-LM:

Support for multiple LLM architectures, and training features like:

  * OpenBMB's MiniCPM and MiniCPM3
  * Kyutai's Helium
  * State-Space's Mamba v1
  * Z.ai & THUKEG's GLM4
  * Allenai's OLMoE
  * Rednote dots.llm1
  * Baisu's Ernie4.5 MoE
  * Full-fine-tuning
  * Reporting training metrics to WandB (Weights & Biases)
  * Multiple Optimizers to choose for training

## üìö My Projects

A mix of serious deep learning research and fun, experimental tools. Expect anything from multimodal LLMs to dataset labeling UIs and decentralized training methods.

## üéØ My Interests

* ü§ñ Artificial & General Intelligence
* üß† Deep Learning, Transformer Architectures, LoRA magic
* üéª Violin ‚Äî Currently practicing Paganini and Bach
* üñåÔ∏è Occasionally sketching or doing photography for inspiration
* üì∫ Huge anime fan (yes, I *have* seen *Berserk*)

## üå± Currently Building:

### **J.O.S.I.E. v4o** ‚Äî my vision for an all-in-one personal assistant

A Real-Time, Full-Duplex, Multimodal Model that can:

* Control my smart home (sensors, cameras, LEDs, etc.) autonomously
* Understand text, images, videos, *and* raw audio (like Whisper + GPT-4o but better)
* Output natural speech & engage in open-ended, real-time convos
* Self-update its memory and tools
* Be fully local, private, and offline-first
* Think and act like an autonomous agent with personality

## üå± I‚Äôm currently perfecting...
- Autonomous Smart home automation using Real-Time, Multi-Modal Model. capable text-audio-vision to text-audio (Project J.O.S.I.E.v4o).

## My private goal is to create J.O.S.I.E.
### My own private smart home management MLLM Assistant that can...
- Autonomously control and manage my Smart home with sensors, cameras, LEDs, and all the other products.
- Tool calling capabilies.
- Raw audio input with normal user(s) speech and other sounds like (fire, etc.).
- Capable of understanding videos and images (e.g. security cameras).
- Capable of outputting natural assistant audio speech and Text (like GPT4-o).
- Can be Real-Time and Text only like GPT4-o.
- Updating itself Autonomously.
- Having a long-/short-term Memory, and even updating it autonimously.
- Real-Time-full-duplex-Multi-Modal-Model
- Starting a conversation by itself (She donsn't need special user and assistant turns).
- And much more...
